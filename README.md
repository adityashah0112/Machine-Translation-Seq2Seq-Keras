# English to French Machine Translation with Seq2Seq Model (Keras)

<p align="center"><img src="images/hello.jpg" height = "256"></p>

This is my implementation of English to French machine translation using **Encoder-Decoder Seq2Seq model** in Keras, as a project for submissions towards course IST 644 - Natural Language Processing  in Spring 2022 Semester in MSIM program at Syracuse University. This work is built upon the original work of @lukysummer.
I worked with a dataset of small vocabulary size (200~300 words).


At the end, the model was able to perfectly translate from an english sentence to a french sentence within the supplemented vocabulary.


## Repository 

This repository contains:
* **data** folder : contains english and french sentences dataset files 
* **machine_translation_seq2seq.py** : Complete code for building, training, and making inference from seq2seq model in Keras
* **machine_translation_seq2seq.ipynb** : step-by-step Jupyter Notebook for for building, training, and making inference from seq2seq model in Keras



## List of Hyperparameters Used:

* Batch Size = **1024**
* Embedding Dimension = **200**
* Number of hidden nodes in LSTM = **256**
* Activation Function for encoder & decoder LSTM layer = **ReLU**
* Learning Rate = **0.002**
* Number of Epochs = **16**
